# Breast-Cancer.
: The project was to develop a software that could predict whether a person has a breast cancer. It would. Ask for the details of lump as inputs and give the result as output. I used the concept of machine learning in it and the concept was of Perceptron,it is a linear classifier and is used in supervised learning.What it does is,it takes the inputs and multiplies with weigth and then it applies the weighted sum to activation function. Activation function is required to map the input between required values like (0,1). 
These steps help to classify the data and we can get the desired result of breast cancer.

## [Run the project on Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Sid06/Breast-Cancer./blob/master/majorproject.ipynb)
